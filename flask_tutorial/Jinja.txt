<!-- This is called template inheritance. This is very useful when we want to create a webpage that inherits
         all the designs of a present webpage with just a slight change in its components. It uses a language called jinja.
         Everything written b/w
         {% block content(here content is a variable and can be anything.It just indicates the name of the block)%}
         {% endblock %}
         can be edited while inheriting the current html page.
         It can be done by using the follwing code while creating a new html file.
         Ex. New file name is profile.html. Then instead of writing the whole code of html, it can be done in a following manner
         {% extends "index.html" %}
         {% block content %}
         ....new website code....
         {% endblock %}
         This will create a new profile.html file with all the components same as index.html but with a change deisgn for the codes
         written in the block.
