You can call a Python function automatically after the return of another function by using the return of the previous function as its parameter. Hereâ€™s an example:

def func1():
    return 1

def func2(x):
    print(x)

func2(func1())
In this example, func1() returns 1 and passes it as an argument to func2(). func2() then prints out the value of x which is 1.

I hope this helps!
